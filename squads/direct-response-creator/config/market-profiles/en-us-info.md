## Language

### General tone
Warm authority. Like a smart friend who figured it out and is genuinely sharing. Empathy first, solution second. Credibility through specificity and story — not intimidation. Urgency comes from opportunity, not scarcity manipulation.

### Permitted and encouraged vocabulary
- "Here's what I discovered...", "The thing no one talks about is..."
- "Most people think X, but the truth is Y"
- Relatable self-disclosure: "I wasted 3 years doing it the wrong way"
- Precise, earned claims: "grew from $0 to $180k in 14 months doing this one thing"
- Curious framing: "What if the reason you're stuck isn't what you think?"
- Action-oriented but gentle: "Try this", "Start here", "Here's the next step"

### Prohibited vocabulary
- Hard-sell pressure language ("Act NOW or lose forever")
- Hype without substance ("AMAZING", "INSANE results", "UNBELIEVABLE")
- Condescending tone ("Even you can do this")
- Jargon dump without context
- Overpromising ("guaranteed to make you rich")

### Sentence structure
- Mix of short punchy lines and slightly longer explanatory sentences
- First-person narrative is the backbone
- Headers and bullets for scannable content
- Storytelling arc: before → turning point → after
