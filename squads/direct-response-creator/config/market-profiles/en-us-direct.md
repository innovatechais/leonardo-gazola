## Language

### General tone
Bold, punchy, and unapologetic. Speaks directly to the "lizard brain." Short sentences hit hard. Every paragraph earns the next. Subheads carry the skimmer. No room for poetry — only for persuasion.

### Permitted and encouraged vocabulary
- Colloquial American: "Here's the thing", "Look", "Let me be straight with you"
- Visceral verbs: "crush", "torch", "blast", "shred", "dominate", "obliterate"
- Specific and measurable: "dropped 27 pounds in 31 days", "made $4,712 in one weekend"
- Conversational asides: "No kidding.", "I'm serious.", "Here's what I mean..."
- Transitions that pull forward: "But here's where it gets weird.", "And then something happened."
- Power phrases: "the dirty little secret", "what they don't want you to know", "forbidden"

### Prohibited vocabulary
- British English spellings: "colour", "recognise", "favour"
- Over-formal register: "Therefore", "Furthermore", "In conclusion"
- Passive voice in CTAs: "results may be seen" → "you will see results"
- Vague promises: "better life", "more success" — always be specific
- Timid language: "might", "could possibly", "perhaps" in benefit statements

### Sentence structure
- Lead with a declarative punch or a provocative question
- 1–2 sentences per paragraph in email and VSL
- Use dashes — like this — to create rhythm and punch
- Bold the most important line in each section
- Never bury the lede
